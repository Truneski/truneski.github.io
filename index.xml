      <description>Introduction After completing the OSCP, I wanted to really learn python and create a tool that would be useful to the InfoSec community. A while back, I saw a few awesome tools leveraging command and control for Cobaltstrike via the External c2 specification. Specifically, the post from Rhino Security Labs caught my eye since it was built specifically for Cobaltstrike using the Externalc2 specification and most importantly it was made using python.</description>

      <description>Consider a scenario where a Penetration Tester is trying to set up command and control on an internal network blocking all outbound traffic, except traffic towards a few specific servers or 3rd party File Sharing websites. In this situation, there are still a few options a tester can use. One of those is DNS command and control and the other is Command and control over file sharing sites such as Dropbox and Google docs.</description>
